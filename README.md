## Overview
Was playing with HTML canvas one night and decided to make the old nibbles game from the qbasic days. 

The code here is thrown together, no tests and no refactoring. take it for what it is. 
For best results, make sure the canvas is a multiple of the snake size passed into the constructor. Otherwise collision is stupid

## Controls
* wasd or arrow keys to move
* esc to reset

## Rules
* Don't touch the walls
* Don't touch yourself
* Eat the circles
